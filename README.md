# Energy_Storage_LCOE
In this project, using several large data sets, I first estimated the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) (2018 value) for different applications (transmission, utility, Peaker replacement, residential, commercial, microgrid, distribution services, frequency regulation, and island) in Canada. Then, as the potential future costs of ESSs is necessary for increasing the investorsâ€™ confidence and enabling policymakers to design development strategies, considering the cost reduction forecast by Schmidt et al. (2019) and changing the base year from 2015 to 2018 (the base year in this study), I developed my own learning curves for each technology.
